Searching for jobs can be overwhelming — tracking applications, statuses, and deadlines easily gets messy. The Job Trackerapp was designed to solve that problem by providing a simple, structured, and visually clean way to manage job applications. This project showcases my skills in full-stack development, database design, and creating a smooth, responsive UI that empowers users to stay organized during their job search.
