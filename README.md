Searching for jobs can be overwhelming — tracking applications, statuses, and deadlines easily gets messy. The Job Trackerapp was designed to solve that problem by providing a simple, structured, and visually clean way to manage job applications. This project showcases my skills in full-stack development, database design, and creating a smooth, responsive UI that empowers users to stay organized during their job search.


** Tech Stack at a Glance

Frontend: Next.js + TypeScript + ShadCN UI + TanStack Table

Backend: Express.js + Prisma (structured API and ORM integration)

Database: PostgreSQL (hosted on Supabase)

Deployment: Vercel (frontend) and Render (backend)

Together, these technologies form a full-stack solution that’s fast, reliable, and easily scalable. Perfect for tracking hundreds of job applications efficiently.
